###Installation instructions

Go here: https://github.com/ac7/hood

Download the latest zip or clone the repository.

Go here: http://love2d.org/

Get LOVE2D 0.9.1 and install it in a directory where you can find it again. Run
the love2d executable on the `hood` directory. That will launch the game. There
aren't any packaged releases yet because the game is still in early development.
